This git repository hosts all related drawings, layouts and schematics
to build a TESTBOX test system.

== preliminary remarks
One part of the Real Time Linux collaborative project is the continous
integration project https://ci-rt.linutronix.de/RT-Test/[CI-RT].

One part of the testsuite performs different tests on the devices under test
(DUT). To ease the hardware integration of the DUT to the test infrastructure
the DUT need to comply with some
https://ci-rt.linutronix.de/download/system-requirements.pdf[hardware
requirements].

It turned out that some DUTs need special hardware extensions to meet the
test infrastructure hardware requirements. Furthermore the wish for hardware
assisted tests grow up.

The idea of a standardized adaption system was born: the TESTBOX.

== hardware
The TESTBOX is based on the http://www.banana-pi.org/r1.html[Banana Pi R1
router board]. This board includes several physical interfaces:

 * 5-port Ethernet Switch
 * CAN
 * GPIOs
 * I2C
 * RS232
 * SPI
 * USB

The board is supported by the mainline
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/tree/arch/arm/boot/dts/sun7i-a20-lamobo-r1.dts?h=linux-4.9.y[Linux Kernel].
Since most interfaces are routed to pinheaders and lack of a physical adaption
a board shield was developed.

http://kicad-pcb.org[KiCAD] is used to create all schematics and the layout.

== software
To create the root file system of the TESTBOX http://elbe-rfs.org/[E.L.B.E.]
is used. E.L.B.E. provides a reproducable way to create
http://debian.org[Debian-based] root file systems.

=== E.L.B.E. root file system
The receipe to build a root file system for the TESTBOX can be found under
